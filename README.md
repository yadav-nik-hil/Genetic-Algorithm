# Genetic-Algorithm
Application of Genetic Algorithm for solving an equation

This algorithm is a very basic application for solving a given equation.
If we increase the population size to 10 and also increasing the generations to 100 or 200, we can gain better results.
I would also like to emphasize that, reducing the upper limit on the search space can lead to better results faster than the previous limit of 30. This change would give a faster result speed (as the search space is reduced), but only at a cost of some possible solutions.
